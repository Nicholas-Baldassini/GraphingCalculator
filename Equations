Documentation
This file stores the explicit equations used in main.py

Input equations below the END OF DOCUMENTATION line

Must use correct python syntax when inputting equations

To use powers, use ** syntax, 2 to the power of two would be 2**2,
3 to the power of sin(x) is 3**math.sin(x)... do not use ^ syntax

When using functions/constants such as cos(x), sin(x), tan(x), e, pi use the
math. prefix notation before hand, lastly always graph with respect to x.

Default equations are provided, can add up to a total of ten equations.
