Documentation
This is the document to display any equations to be inputted into the system

Must use correct python syntax

To use powers, use ** notation, 2 to the power of two would be 2**2,
3 to the power of sin(x) is 3**math.sin(x)...

When using functions/constants such as cos(x), sin(x), tan(x), e, pi use the
math. prefix notation before hand, lastly always graph with respect to x.
